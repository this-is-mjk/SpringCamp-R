hi myself manas jain kuniya, 230626, BS MTH

> the code is in  python
> there are 3 function prepare(), wingsort(), roomisort().
> i was not able to figure out how to fetch data, while observing the networks tab i found the json file of the data.
  which in turn i used as the base.
> prepare() prepares the data form the json file to csv and keeps only the required data
> wingsort() creates a new csv file for wing and hall given, it creates a empty file if the wing do not have any one.
> roomisort() takes 2 rollnumbers and finds out are they roomi.
> you can run the code i have attached all the data files with it, 
  you may require to change the location in line 12 of the data.json according to your pc.

> i will really love to know what can i improve and how can i get the request url to get the data.json file form web.

>thank you
